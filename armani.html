<h4>Design&#58; Mobile</h4>
    <h5>IDEA&#58;</h5>

    <div class="projects-textnexttoimage">
     
      <h5>PART 1&#58;</h5> 
      <p>Stimulating the in-store experience, the first part comprises of questions (style, fit etc.) that help narrow down the selection of fabrics and styles displayed in the later stages. The tone of the copy is kept conversational. </p>

      <p>The next part takes full advantage of gestures on a mobile screen. The user is presented with a 360 deg stimulation of the suit. The user is free to change the fabric, lining and buttons. The changes are instantly reflected in the 360 deg model. The user also can choose the sizes and then proceed. </p>
