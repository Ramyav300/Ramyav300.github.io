 </section>

  <section class="project-details">

    <h4>Brief</h4>
    <p>To review the user interface and experience of the ATM Kiosk and mobile app and enhance their usability.</p>
    
    <p>My role: UX Designer, Team Leader</p>
    
    <p>Size of team: 4 members</p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>The approach to design was systematic and the process was iterative We took a very systematic approach to this project with multiple feedback cycles and iterations.</p>

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>The initial phase included 3 types of research:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Observations</li><li>Interviews</li><li>Surveys</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Key takeaways:</p>


    <ul>
    <li>Users were distributed almost evenly across the two channels of purchase - ATM kiosks and Buying in a Tabacchi.</li>
    <li>Lack of clear and accessible information induces cognitive stress.</li>
    <li>ATM kiosks and the app were perceived to be intimidating to new users; high level of errors.</li>
    </ul>
    



  


    <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
    <p> From the card sorting exercises conducted, a clear information architecture emerged. </p>
