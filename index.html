   <h2>About me</h2>

    <img src="images/default-user.png" alt="my picture" class="profile-pic">

    <p>My name is Ramya. I’m a visual designer turned web designer (surprise, surprise) currently based in Milan. Armed with my undergraduate degree in Communication Design, I began my career in retail advertising.</p>

    <p>Three years in the advertising taught me more than I anticipated and it’s during my three-year stint at a Bangalore based ad agency where I discovered the digital medium.</p>

    <p>It intrigued, captivated and fascinated me.</p>

    <p>The constant flux, steady progress, development and a chance to create anything your heart desires, had me hooked.</p>

    <p>I began with an exploration of UI design and through this process found my calling – UX design. It’s been quite the journey arriving at my specialisation in UX design and while I continue to work in UI design simultaneously, UX is where my passion lies.</p>

    <p>Besides my work in the digital space I also enjoy experimenting with typography, well-designed typefaces, any design that involves grids, design research and analysis.</p>
